# Benjolin_1x
Benjolin_1x KiCAD data. I designed this PCB based on the schematics of Forest Caver's Benjolin 1.6. Then added some additional ideas from Jolin Lab's BE2N. I am really grateful to Rob Hordijk, who designed the original Benjolin. Following the original Benjolin design intent, this PCB is for personal, non-commercial use only.
